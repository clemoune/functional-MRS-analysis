Data available on resquest (corresponding author: Noam Shemesh). Update to come when available on MRShub.

To run the code with data, simply drag the files/folders inside each data folder of the same letter/name. Each script is self-consistent.

These scripts are not (yet) flexible to other type of datasets: some parameters are hard-coded (notably some support functions are tailored for this specific field/bandwidth - 9.4T / 4000 Mhz / 2048 pts). Most likely easy to tweak if needed. 

The code for the fMRI analysis has been developed by Francisca Fernandes and is available here: https://github.com/francisca-fernandes/fmri-analysis.
